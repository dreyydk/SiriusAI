# SiriusAI - Landing Page

This project is a landing page developed for a fictitious artificial intelligence company called "Sirius". Its purpose is to improve and demonstrate my skills in the main technologies I work with.

What stands out most about this project is the complexity of designs and animations developed to be the most eye-catching as possible.

## Stack

**Front-end:** Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS.

**Addons:** Framer, Lottie.
